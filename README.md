## Sprints

### Sprint 1 - Launching the application as a GUI
For this sprint, we designed the wireframe of the application using the JavaFX library. 
We also integrated maven into our project so that we can install and run the JavaFX application easily. We decided to split the task into 4 different stories
(Stage, ScrollPane, ColorPicker and Options Pane) and everyone is responsible for one component. After that, we combined everything together using a Layout 
class when everyone is finished with their part. Our final product also included two sample characters to show that our GUI will in fact work nicely
with the character images.
